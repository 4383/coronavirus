# **Citation** 
##### Wang, M., Cao, R., Zhang, L. et al. Remdesivir and chloroquine effectively inhibit the recently emerged novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) in vitro. Cell Res 30, 269â€“271 (2020).

# **Summary of Article** 
  * Tested the efficacy of different drugs against 2019-nCoV **in vitro**
    * 5 FDA-approved drugs (_ribavirin, penciclovir, nitazoxanide, nafamostat, chloroquine_)
                                      **Vs.**
    * 2 broad-spectrum antiviral drugs ( _Remdesivir and Favipiravir_) against a clinical isolate 
  * Assessed 3 different parameters to determine the efficacy of the drug against coronavirus (2019-nCoV)
    * Cytotoxicity
    * Virus Yield
    * Infection Rates
  * RESULT- Remdesivir and Chloroquine _more_ effective to inhibit 2019-nCoV. The EC90 value of **Remdesivir = 1.76 uM** and **Chloroquine = 6.90 uM** against 2019-nCoV in Vero E6 cells signifies that these can further be applicable for clinical drug development against 2019-nCoV. The other reason that the drugs are safer to be developed further for 2019-nCoV is because these drugs have previously been tested in human patients with safety track record for other viral ailments.

# **Additional Notes** 
  * **2019-nCoV**, MERS-CoV and SARS CoV- all 3 belong to the same **Betacorona** virus family
  * Ribavirin, inteferon, lopinavir-ritonavir, and corticosteroids used in past to target SARS and MERS
  * **What each drug treated in the past?**
    * |Drug|Function|
      |--- |---|
      |Ribavirin+Penciclovir+Favipiravir| Viral infection|
      |Favipiravir| 100% effective for mice EBola|
      |Nafamostat| Inhibitor of MERS-CoV|
      |Nitazoxanide| Antiprotozoal agent/Inhibitor of human and animal coronavirus|
      |**Remdesivir**| RNA Viruses- SARS/MERS-CoV in mice/cells/nonhuman primates + Under clinical development for Ebola infection|
      |**Chloroquine**| Anti-malarial and used in autoimmune disease + Antiviral|

   * **How does Remdesivir and Chloroquine act against 2019-nCov and with what efficiency?**
     * Remdesivir-
        - Function post viral entry
        - Inhibited virus infection in Vero E6 cells and human cell line Huh-7 
     * Chloroquine- 
        - Function both at viral entry and post entry stages in Vero E6 cells
        - Immune modulating effect also helps its antiviral property invivo



  * **METHODS**  
    * Cells used- **Vero E6 Cells**
    * |PARAMETER  | ACCESSMENT METHOD | PROCESS| 
      |---|---|---|---| 
      | Cytotoxity | CCK-8 Assays| Vero E6 infected with 2019-CoV and diff doses of antivirals for 48hrs- assessed cytotoxicity% and inhibition%|
      | Viral Yield| qRT-PCR| Quantification of viral copies in cell supernatant via _qRT-PCR_. Vero E6 Cells were treated with 2019-CoV and virus yield in the infected supernatants quantified by qRT-PCR and NP expression analyzed using Western Blot
      | Virus Infection| Immunoflurescence Microscopy| Visualization of virus NP expression 48hrs post treatment with Remdesivir and Chloroquine|
