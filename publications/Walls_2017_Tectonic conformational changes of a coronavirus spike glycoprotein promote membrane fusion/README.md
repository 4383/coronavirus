# **Summary of Article**
* Crystal structure of MHV (_Mouse hepatitis virus_, a coronavirus) S2 postfusion machinery (**PDB: 6B3O**)


# **Additional Notes**
* All notes taken while reading article
* MHV, SARS-CoV, and MERS-CoV are able to be cleaved by trypsin at S1/S2 and S2' sites
* TMPRSS processes SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV; furin processes other coronavirus as well as MERS-CoV in early endosomes; lysosomal protease mediated triggering of SARS-CoV also occurs

**Pre- and Post-Fusion Differences**
* prefusion S2 trimer is 88A long and 40A wide
* postfusion S2 trimer is 185A long and 15-50A wide
* according to previous research, postfusion is most stable conformation of spike
