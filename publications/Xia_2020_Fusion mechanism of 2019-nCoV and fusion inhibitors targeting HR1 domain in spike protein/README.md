# **Summary of Article**
* Sequence alignment analysis to determine functional regions of SARS-CoV-2
* They confirm that the 6-helical bundle found in SARS-CoV is also found in SARS-CoV-2; they use CD to confirm helicity
* An HR2 peptide based on SARS-CoV-2 as well as the EK1 peptide inhibit membrane fusion and pseudovirus infection of SARS-CoV-2, HR1 does not
