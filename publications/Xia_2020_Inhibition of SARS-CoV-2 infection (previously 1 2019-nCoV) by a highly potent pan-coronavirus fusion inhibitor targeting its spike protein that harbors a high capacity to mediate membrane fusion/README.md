Xia, S. _et al_. Inhibition of SARS-CoV-2 infection (previously 2019-nCoV) by a highly potent pan-coronavirus fusion inhibitor targeting its spike protein that harbors a high capacity to mediate membrane fusion. http://biorxiv.org/lookup/doi/10.1101/2020.03.09.983247 (2020) doi:10.1101/2020.03.09.983247.


# **Summary of Article**
* Improvements of a previously designed peptide, EK1 (Xia et al. 2019), which binds to HR1 and inhibits fusion of many coronaviruses
* EK1C4 was the best of several lipoproteins designed; contains an additional GS linker to a PEG4-Cholesterol and **blocked protein-mediated membrane fusion and pseudovirus infection with IC50 1.3 and 15.8nM**
* Several mutations of HR1 from SARS-CoV to SARS-CoV-2 indicate stronger association with HR2, as evidenced by SARS-CoV-2's enhanced fusion capacity

# **Additional Notes**

**SARS-CoV-2 Enhanced Fusion**
* SARS-CoV-2 showed ability to fuse ACE2/293T cells as well as Huh-7 cells, which SARS-CoV did not show (Fig 1)
* also does not seem to require trypsin

**Crystal Structure of Fusion Core**
* Residues 910-988 and 1162-1206 connected with flexible linker (SGGRGG) and crystal structure obtained (**PDB 6LXT**)
* HR1 forms parallel trimeric coiled-coil around which HR2 attach antiparallel
* primarily hydrophobic interaction, however several mutations from SARS-CoV indicate increased short range electrostatic and hydrogen bonding interactions (Fig 3)

**Peptide Design**
* peptide lipidation has shown to increase antiviral activity of fusion inhibitory peptides
* advantage of local administration (to lungs) via inhalation formulation
* of 103 SARS-CoV-2 genomes identified, both HR1 and HR2 domains show 100% identity


**Mouse Work**
* Administered intranasally before or after challenge with HCoV-OC43 (a different beta-coronavirus)
  - have to take the curves loosely because HCoV-OC43 infects the brain and this peptide cannot block viral replication once it makes it to the brain
* Survival curves (Fig 6f-g) show poor protection of mouse survival if administered more than 12 hours before, but full protection if less than 4 hours before
* Similarly, poor protection if administered 2 hour after viral challenge but full protection if administered 0.5 hrs after challenge
* However, these results are much better than for EK1, and mice in the Pre-0.5, Pre-2, Pre-4, Pre-12, and Post-0.5 group as well as the normal control group showed no change in histopathology in the brain.
