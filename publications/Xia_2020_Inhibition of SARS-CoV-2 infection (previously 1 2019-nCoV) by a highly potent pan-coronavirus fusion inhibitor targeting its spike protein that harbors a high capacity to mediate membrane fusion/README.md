Xia, S. _et al_. Inhibition of SARS-CoV-2 infection (previously 2019-nCoV) by a highly potent pan-coronavirus fusion inhibitor targeting its spike protein that harbors a high capacity to mediate membrane fusion. http://biorxiv.org/lookup/doi/10.1101/2020.03.09.983247 (2020) doi:10.1101/2020.03.09.983247.


# **Summary of Article**
* Improvements of a previously designed peptide, EK1 (Xia et al. 2019), which binds to HR1 and inhibits fusion of many coronaviruses
* EK1C4 was the best of several lipoproteins designed; contains an additional GS linker to a PEG4-Cholesterol

# **Additional Notes**
* Survival curves (Fig 6f-g) show poor protection of mouse survival if administered more than 12 hours before, but full protection if less than 4 hours before (likely getting cleared from the body)
* Similarly, poor protection if administered 2 hour after viral challenge but full protection
