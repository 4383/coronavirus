# **Summary of Article**
There are two alpha helices (HR1 and HR2) of the SARS-CoV spike protein that form a coiled coil that’s important for virus entering the cell. This can be inhibited using HR2 peptide mimetics, but nor HR1.

* During the viral fusion process in SARS-CoV , one of the conformational states of the envelope spike (S) protein involved two regions: HR1 and HR2 form a stable alpha-helix coiled coil (AKA “the virus fusion core “).
* The coiled coil is believed to be important for bringing the virus membrane and host membrane close enough for fusion for viral entry.
* It’s possible to introduce HR peptides that bind to the endogenous HR peptides, therefor inhibiting the transition.
* This paper expresses the HR1 and HR2 in E. coli and show that HR2 is a potent fusion inhibitor. IC50 is 0.5–5 nM for the synthetic HR2 peptide and 66.2–500 nM for a GST fusion HR2.
* They saw no effect when trying to inhibit using HR1 as an inhibitor.
