# **Summary of Article**
* Structure-based drug design of alpha-ketoamide inhibitor of SARS-CoV-2 3CL-PRO (**13b**), using 1.75 Å apo crystal structure of 3CL-PRO (6Y2E) and **13b**-bound monomer 1.95 Å (6Y2F), and **13b**-bound dimer 2.20 Å (6Y2G)
* Improves pharmacokinetics of previously designed inhibitor of coronaviruses and  enteroviruses (**11b**) using mouse models and microsomes (no data shown)

# **Additional Notes**
**Intro**
* Follows from this work: α-Ketoamides as Broad-Spectrum Inhibitors of Coronavirus and Enterovirus Replication: Structure-Based Design, Synthesis, and Activity Assessment (https://doi.org/10.1021/acs.jmedchem.9b01828)
* Apo crystal structure of 3CL-PRO at 1.75 Å (6Y2E) used to guide optimization of a series of alpha-ketoamide inhibitors
* Goal was to improve pharmacokinetic properties of the compounds
* 1.95 and 2.20 Å crystal structures (6Y2F, 6Y2G) with the most potent alpha-ketoamide (**13b**)

**Biological Function**
* Operates at 11 cleavage sites using primarily the recognition motif Leu-Gln*(Ser, Ala, Gly)

**Structural Features**
* Domain I: 10-99
* Domain II: 100-182
* Domain III: 198-303
* Domains I and II are beta-barrels, Domain III is a globular cluster of five helices
* Catalytic Dyad: Cys145, His41 (coordinate water molecule)
* Oxyanion Hole: Gly143, Cys145, Ser144
* S2 pocket: flexibility that lets it accommodate smaller inhibitor moieties

**Dimerization**
* Obligate dimer, with N-term of one protomer (“N-finger”) sandwiched between its own Domain II and III and making contacts with Domain II of the second protomer
* Dimerization is needed for catalysis, with the N-finger and nearby residues of one protomer interacting with in particular Glu166 of the other protomer, shaping its S1 pocket

**Differences from SARS-2 3CL-PRO**
* Domain III of SARS-2 3CL-PRO has a Thr285Ala mutation which enables tighter hydrophobic packing across the dimer, involving residues A285 and I286.
* Previous study showed that Ser284A, Thr285Ala, and Ile286Ala combination mutations enabled 3.6-fold increase in catalytic activity

**Drug Design**
* Previously developed **11r**, which had EC50 of 400pM against MERS-CoV in Huh7 cells as well as low uM against SARS-CoV
* Catalytic cysteine undergoes nucleophilic attack onto the alpha-keto group, forming a stable, but reversible covalent adduct
* **11r alpha-ketoamide**
  - P3: cinnamoyl
  - P2: cyclohexyl
  - P1: gamma-lactam (mimics glutamine)
  - alpha-ketone
  - P1’: phenyl
* **Improvements from 11r to 13a:**
  - P3-P2 → pyridone ring
  - Cinnamoyl group → tert-butyl carbamate
* **Improvements from 13a to 13b:**
  - P2 cyclohexyl → cyclopropyl
  - **13b** Crystal Structures
  - 6Y2G shows biological assembly stabilizes inactive conformation (based on Glu166 orientation)
  - IC50 = 0.67 +/-0.18 uM against SARS-CoV-2

**Pharmacokinetics**
* **11r** to **13a**: increased half-life in human plasma; after 24 hrs at 135 ng/g in mouse lung tissue
* **13a** to **13b**: lost broad-spectrum activity but increase beta-coronavirus specific activity, which compensated for some loss in activity from 11r to 13a

**Future Directions**
* Larger moieties than the P3 pyridone ring can be accommodated by the area where the substrate’s main chain normally is
* Working on testing against SARS-CoV-2 cell cultures and small-animal models
