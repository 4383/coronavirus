# **Summary of Article**
Computational screen of 687 M compounds (3D Zinc database) against the SARS-CoV-2 main protease (PDB 6LU7) finds 11 potential inhibitors.

### Biology
* Protease inhibition has been a successful strategy for HIV and hepatitis C, and thought to be a promising target for SARS-CoV-2 also. 
* Despite high sequence identity (96.1%) between SARS-CoV-1 and SARS-CoV-2 proteases, drugs for SARS-CoV-1 have shown little benefit for SARS-CoV-2. 
* Only one amino acid difference between the two protease active sites (Ser46) (A46S), but difference in active site surface topology.
* Peptides and peptidomimetics are commonly used for targeting proteases, however small molecules are the focus here as they may have easier bioavailability, better metabolic stability and cheaper. 

### Compchem
* Shape-based screening against known binders for SARS-CoV-1 main protease inhibitorsx
* Two different docking protocols
	* smina (5 representative protein structures)
	* Glide SP
* Assessment based on pharmacokinetic molecular descriptors
* Fingerprint clustering to ensure diversity. Two best-scored Glide molecules from each cluster checked for lipiski and Veber criteria. 
* MD, MM/GBSA
* Assessed against 16 known drug off-targets
* results in 11 compounds that are predicted higher affinity than N3 (molecule in xtal structure)
