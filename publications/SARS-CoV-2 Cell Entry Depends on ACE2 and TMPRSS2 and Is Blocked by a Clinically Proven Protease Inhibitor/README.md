# **Summary of Article**
* SARS-2-S is more efficiently cleaved by human proteases than SARS-S, indicating a potential source of SARS-CoV-2's increased infectivity
* SARS-2-S, like SARS-S, is able to utilize endosomal cysteine proteases CatB/L, as well as serine protease TMPRSS2 for priming of viral fusion
* A clinically approved TMPRSS2 inhibitor (in Japan), camostat mesylate, is able to block SARS-2-S-driven entry into lung model cells as well as primary human epithelial cells

# **Additional Notes**
**Cell entry**
* S1 (which includes the RBD) binds to the cellular receptor ACE2
* S protein is cleaved at S1/S2 (SARS-2-S AA # 685) and S2’ (SARS-2-S AA # 815) sites, which facilitates fusion of viral and cellular membranes, driven by S2
* SARS-2-S S1/S2 cleavage site has more arginines and is more efficiently cleaved by human proteases than SARS-2
* ACE2, the receptor targeted by SARS-S, and not DPP4, the receptor used by MERS-CoV, is used for SARS-2-S entry into human cells
* ACE2 is expressed in human airway epithelial cells, although it has only modest expression in the upper respiratory tract

**Protease Activity**
* SARS-CoV can use endosomal cysteine proteases CatB/L, as well as serine protease TMPRSS2. In SARS inhibition of both proteases is required to block viral entry but only inhibition of TMPRSS2 is required for blocking viral spread and pathogenesis
* SARS-2-S-driven entry into Calu-3 cells (lung model cells) can be blocked by camostate mesylate, EC90 ~5uM
* SARS-2-S-driven entry into primary human epithelial cells can be blocked (~25% entry) by pre-incubation with 50uM camostat mesylate

**Conclusion:**
 SARS-CoV-2 can use TMPRSS2 for S protein priming and camostate mesylate, an inhibitor of TMPRSS2, blocks SARS CoV-2 infection of lung cells. However, I will say that based on the data this is unlikely to be a "cure", but it may help limit infectivity.

 **Antibody Protection**
* Antibodies against SARS-S are able to inhibit SARS-2-S-driven entry partially, and there have been some reports of ADE (antibody-dependent-enhancement) in SARS-2 so I would proceed with caution.
* Better inhibition can be achieved with camostat mesylate
