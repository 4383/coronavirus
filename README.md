# Folding@home COVID-19 efforts

This repository will contain all input files and generated datasets for the [Folding@home](http://foldingathome.org) efforts to better understand how the SARS-CoV-2 virus that causes [COVID-19](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/index.html) can be targeted with small molecule and antibody therapeutics.

This repository will be continuously updated to share results that are being generated on Folding@home.
You can follow along with news updates on the [Folding@home blog](https://foldingathome.org/news/) and [Folding@home twitter feed](https://twitter.com/foldingathome).

More information on this project can be found on [this Folding@home news post](https://foldingathome.org/2020/03/10/covid19-update/).

## Datasets

Links to Folding@home generated datasets will be posted here as soon as the incoming data is batch-processed.

## Participating laboratories
* [Bowman Lab (WashU)](https://bowmanlab.biochem.wustl.edu/) - Folding@home Director
* [Chodera lab (MSKCC)](http://choderalab.org)
* [Voelz lab (Temple)](http://www.voelzlab.org/)

## How to contact / collaborate with us
* Reach out to Folding@home Director [Dr. Greg Bowman](https://bowmanlab.biochem.wustl.edu/) via [email](mailto:g.bowman@wustl.edu) or [twitter](https://twitter.com/drGregBowman)

## Collaborators
* [DiamondMX](https://www.diamond.ac.uk/Instruments/Mx/Fragment-Screening.html) has carried out a fragment screen against the SARS-CoV-2 main viral protease that has generated [many new X-ray structures with small molecules bound](https://www.diamond.ac.uk/covid-19/for-scientists/Main-protease-structure-and-XChem.html) posted openly to advance the development of tool compounds and potential small molecule therapeutics. They are actively looking for funds for purchasing new compounds to screen to elaborate on these initial hits.

# Workflow
1. Prepare input files for simulations on Folding@home (Available in `system_preparation/`)
2. Run simulations *(IN PROGRESS)*
3. Analyze simulations *(COMING SOON)*
