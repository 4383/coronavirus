# **Overview**
* In the interest of usefully focusing our research efforts, we have a growing set of questions we would like to answer.
* Naturally, there are a set of publications which we may briefly read to get a sense of the field, which we will also include in this file along with short (one-sentence) summaries of the reference.
* I think we should try to group these questions by general category.
* **_If you think you know the answer to a question but you don't have time / can't find the reference, go ahead and write the answer anyway._** This way we can take advantage of our collective knowledge.

## **Structure Preparation & Biological Assemblies**
**Is the SARS-CoV-2 main protease a dimer?**
Yes. This protein is also called 3CL-PRO, and it is an obligate dimer. An example structure of the biological assembly is in 6Y2G from Zhang 2020 "X-ray Structure of Main Protease of the Novel Coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 Enables Design of alpha-Ketoamide Inhibitors" (http://biorxiv.org/lookup/doi/10.1101/2020.02.17.952879).

**Do we have to simulate 3CL-PRO as a dimer to make useful drugs?**
Unclear.


## **Drug Design**
**Could we stabilize the monomer of 3CL-PRO and inhibit it by blocking dimerization?**

**What kinds of drugs have been used succesfully against viruses in the past?**
This question is being researched mainly by Binisha Karki, and will be answered in the [target].md files contained in this directory.

**Is there a list of structures / compounds being tested by all the groups?**
I don't know about a single source, but besides the [target].md files in this directory, there is also a set of non-publication resources including a link to the efforts of DiamondMX.


# **Steps in the Viral Life Cycle**
## Spike Protein Opening and Binding to ACE2

### Cleavage of Spike Protein and Fusion with Host Cell Membrane
**How does fusion core get into cell membrane?**

**What happens after fusion with host cell membrane? Endocytosis? Release of viral RNA?**

### Polyprotein Cleavage






# **Future Directions**
**Which viral proteins are involved in the translation of the viral replicase gene into polyprotein pp1ab?**
